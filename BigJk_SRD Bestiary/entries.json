Only the most potent genies, such as those among the nobility, can do so. A particular genie that has this power can grant one to three wishes to a creature that isn't a genie. Once a genie has granted its limit of wishes, it can't grant wishes again for some amount of time (usually 1 year). and cosmic law dictates that the same genie can expend its limit of wishes on a specific creature only once in that creature's existence.\r\nTo be granted a wish, a creature within 60 feet of the genie states a desired effect to it. The genie can then cast the wish spell on the creature's behalf to bring about the effect. Depending on the genie's nature, the genie might try to pervert the intent of the wish by exploiting the wish's poor wording.

Only the most potent genies, such as those among the nobility, can do so. A particular genie that has this power can grant one to three wishes to a creature that isn't a genie. Once a genie has granted its limit of wishes, it can't grant wishes again for some amount of time (usually 1 year). and cosmic law dictates that the same genie can expend its limit of wishes on a specific creature only once in that creature's existence.\r\nTo be granted a wish, a creature within 60 feet of the genie states a desired effect to it. The genie can then cast the wish spell on the creature's behalf to bring about the effect. Depending on the genie's nature, the genie might try to pervert the intent of the wish by exploiting the wish's poor wording.

The harpy must take a bonus action on its subsequent turns to continue singing. It can stop singing at any time. The song ends if the harpy is incapacitated.\r\n     While charmed by the harpy, a target is incapacitated and ignores the songs of other harpies.

A creature can also repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If a creature's saving throw is successful, the effect ends on it.\r\n     A target that successfully saves is immune to this harpy's song for the next 24 hours.","name":"Luring Song"}]},"alignment":"chaotic evil","armor_class":"11","challenge_rating":"1","charisma":"13","constitution":"12","dexterity":"13","hit_dice":"7d8+7","hit_points":"38","intelligence":"7","languages":"Common","name":"Harpy","senses":", passive Perception 10","size":"Medium","speed":"20 ft., fly 40 ft.","strength":"12","type":"monstrosity, monster manual","wisdom":"10"}},{"id":"srd-bestiary/hawk","name":"Hawk","data":{"-icon":"Images/Hawk.png","-private":"0","actions":{"element":{"attack_bonus":"5","damage_bonus":"0","damage_dice":"1d0","desc":"Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.

On a failed save, the creature is infected with a disease called the spores of Zuggtmoy and also gains a random form of madness (determined by rolling on the Madness of Zuggtmoy table) that lasts until the creature is cured of the disease or dies. While infected in this way, the creature can't be reinfected, and it must repeat the saving throw at the end of every 24 hours, ending the infection on a success. On a failure, the infected creature's body is slowly taken over by fungal growth, and after three such failed saves, the creature dies and is reanimated as a spore servant if it's a type of creature that can be (see the \"Myconids\" entry in the Monster Manual).","name":"Infestation Spores (3/Day)"},{"attack_bonus":"0","damage_bonus":"0","damage_dice":"1d0","desc":"Zuggtmoy releases spores that burst out in a cloud that fills a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on her, and it lingers for 1 minute.
